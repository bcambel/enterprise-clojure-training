== What are you waiting for?

.Waiting patiently for Clojure adoption in the workplace
image::img/talk/corgi-waiting.jpg[Corgi waiting at door]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Just among us friends, the potential for Clojure to take over the programming world is obvious.
* But... why isn’t everybody using it yet?
* My name is Timothy Pratley, and this talk is titled "What are you waiting for?"
* This isn't a "why Clojure" talk; most of you are here because you already know and love Clojure
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* I will be introducing an open source training course called Enterprise Clojure Training
* My collaborator Elango will be speaking about the theory and practise of teaching Clojure

* Took me a long time
* See it in others
* Some people get it quickly, some never do
* Check your preconception at the door

== Simple ain't easy

"I had high hopes for Clojure for a while, but they're fairly user-hostile, even if they think (and loudly assert) that they aren't."
-- Steve Yegge


== Tips for learning

* Focus on the language first
* Focus on the mental shift second
* Try to delay investing in tools and editors
* Join the community
* Find a teacher
* Ask questions


== Join the community

"I am so happy with, and proud of, the Clojure community. People are helpful, and respectful, and positive. I think the key point is that the community values itself, such that people will decide it is more important to preserve the quality of the community than to vent their emotions or prove themselves right."
-- Rich Hickey

== At work

.How did I get here?
image::img/corgi.jpg[Corgi with tie and glasses]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* Part one of that is providing a resource
* Part two is sharing my path
* And to do that I must first begin with how I came to Clojure

== Rewind << 2007

.My first encounter with Lisp
image::img/talk/corgi-encounter.jpg[Corgi encounters budgie]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In 2007 I was a bit of a know it all kind of programmer
* Hiring an engineer, their code submission was... concise, elegant
* I didn’t understand it
* It was in a language I didn’t know
* I thought I knew all the languages: C, C++ and Java
* It must be one of those weird languages we dabbled with at university like prolog or haskell
* It was Lisp
* Well fine, I can program in any language, I’ll just learn the constructs and...
* Six months later I was ready to put lisp back in it’s box
* I’d worked through SICP and onlisp, and written small programs
* There was an elegance to the concepts,
* but applying them to the kinds of computation I wanted to do was not practical
* Then this happened:

Hello,

As someone interested in Foil or jFli, I thought you might want to
know about my latest project - Clojure, a dialect of Lisp for the
JVM. It's currently alpha, but fairly complete. I'm looking for some
feedback from some intrepid folks willing to kick the tires.
http://clojure.sourceforge.net/

Please use the Google group for feedback:
http://groups.google.com/group/clojure

Regards and thanks,

Rich

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I was instantly hooked
* I could build stuff!
* Even render 3d images!
* Fnil - completely new way of thinking, solves a real problem in an unexpected way.
* Not really an option for my day job
* Clojure was for personal projects

== 2010

image::img/talk/corgi-team.jpg[Corgis carrying a branch together]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Managing a team of 12 people building logistics software
* Using C#
* Agile
* I build Version One plugins
* Technical challenges would be so much easier in Clojure
* But how could I transition my team over?
* I didn't think it was possible on my own
--


== 2014

image::img/talk/corgi-herding-ducks.jpg[Corgi herding ducks]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Joined a startup using Ruby
* Transitioning to entirely Clojure/ClojureScript
* Clojure scales
* Large teams
* Large codebase
* Build an entire system in a month
* Training people wasn't so hard
--


== 2018

Suiteness is the place to find rooms that connect to suites for half the price of a 2 bedroom suite.
So you can stretch out without stretching your budget.
Or you can find all the space and affordability of a vacation rental with the amenities of a hotel.

* Our biggest users are families and group events.

== Why didn't I convert my team to Clojure?

.I can't do this on my own
image::img/talk/corgi-asleep-at-vet.jpg[Corgi asleep at the vet]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What prevents companies from sliding into Clojure en masse?
* What prevented me from converting my team to Clojure?
* Main obstacle; How could I get my team up and running on Clojure quickly
* It felt like it was too much to do on my own
* Needed training, another expert, C-level buy in
* It's hard to believe that you can switch languages effectively without some help
* You do need some help
* What can we do about it?
--


== Many people don't know anything about Clojure

.Looking different can feel weird
image::img/talk/corgi-weird.jpeg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's natural to be suspicious of what we don't know
* They have real concerns
  - Is it really better?
  - Is this for "regular" programmers?
  - Can we learn it?
  - Who will support it?
  - Can we hire people?
--


== What are *developers* waiting for?

.Jobs!
image::img/talk/clojure-jobs.png[Clojure job listings]


== What are *companies* waiting for?

.Developers!
image::img/talk/corgi-developer.jpg[Corgi using a laptop]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's hard to hire for Clojure
  - not really though
--


== What are *learners* waiting for?

.A market!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The first question a beginner asks is which language should I learn?
* The standard answer is JavaScript, Java, Python
* Clojure is a better tools for thought
  - Maps/sets/vectors
  - Concise algorithm expression
  - Focus on important concepts
  - Less baggage and distractions
  - Reach mastery of algorithmic concepts faster
* Supply and demand is not as simple as "most used"
  - Supply and demand does not favor the most popular
  - The most popular market is also the most average market
  - You will benefit from an imbalance in supply to demand found in smaller markets
* The future is ... the future
  - You will be writing something else in the future
  - I have used a different programming language in every job I have worked
  - Good employers value skills, knowledge and culture over specific technology experience
  - Fortran, Cobol, VisualBasic, PHP, C# were the popular choices once
  - Things change
  - Optimize for computer science mastery, not basics
  - Language choice matters

== What are *employees* waiting for?

.A greenfield!
image::img/talk/corgi-on-field.jpg[Corgi on a green field]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Room to do things right
* Figure out what that means
* But why not do some boring stuff too?
--


== What are *employers* waiting for?

.A framework!
image::img/talk/corgi-in-crate.jpg[Corgi in dog crate]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Something to start with and add to
* Get going quickly
* Structure
* That's all totally possible
--


== Is Clojure Enterprise?

image::img/talk/popularity.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I get to use it at work
* I've built Enterprise Systems with it
* Several large companies do use it
* There are Clojure jobs available
--


== Or not?

image::img/talk/most-used-jvm.jpg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Still a niche
* Secret weapon, and that's O.K.
* Value principles over popularity
  ** simplicity
  ** thinking
  ** community
--


== Why do I care?

* Clojure makes me happy
* I want you to be happy too
* There are obstacles
* There is uncertainty
* There is opportunity


== Clojure adoption

.A challenging knot to approach
image::img/talk/corgi-rope.jpg[Corgi pulling a rope]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Clojure adoption seems like a challenging knot to approach.
* In 333 B.C. Alexander the Great marched his army into Gordium in modern day Turkey.
* He encountered an ancient wagon tied with knots so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened.
* Tradition held that the wagon had once belonged to Gordius, the father of the celebrated King Midas.
* An oracle had declared that anyone who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia.
* Alexander proclaimed "It makes no difference how they are loosed," drew his sword and sliced the knot in half with a single stroke.

The Gordian Knot story is one to take inspiration from.
Don't over-think it, see past implied limitations, be decisive.
--


== Clojure is a great choice for your company

* Books
* Great community
* Experts
* Jobs
* Cognitect
* Training


== Start using Clojure already

.Confidence from training

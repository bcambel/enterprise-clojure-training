== What are you waiting for?

.Waiting patiently for Clojure adoption in the workplace
image::img/talk/corgi-waiting.jpg[Corgi waiting at door]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Just among us friends, the potential for Clojure to take over the programming world is obvious.
* But... why isn’t everybody using it yet?
* My name is Timothy Pratley, and this talk is titled "What are you waiting for?"
* This isn't a "why Clojure" talk; most of you are here because you already know and love Clojure
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* I will be introducing an open source training course called Enterprise Clojure Training
* My collaborator Elango will be speaking about the theory and practise of teaching Clojure

.Under the hood of Enterprise Clojure Training
image::img/talk/corgi-hoodie.jpg[]


== Asciidoctor

* Asciidoc is a flavor of markdown
* Better for publishing
* Excellent tooling support
* Github and Github Pages

NOTE: Asciidoctor is an improved implementation of Asciidoc


== Flavor of markdown

link:../docs/advanced-topics.adoc[advanced-topics.adoc]

link:../docs/talk.adoc[talk.adoc]

link:../docs/index.adoc[index.adoc]


== Better for publishing

* Automatic table of contents
* Create books, slides, web pages
* Output as HTML, PDF, DocBook, ePub
* Tables
* Code highlighting
* Style customization

TIP: Note/tip/warning callouts


== Excellent tooling

* Produces attractive content by default
* Brew, apt, ruby, bundler, node, docker
* Editor plugins

== IntelliJ IDEA

.Asciidoctor plugin
image::img/talk/idea-asciidoctor.png[]


== Chrome live reloading

* Renders in the browser direct from `.adoc`
* Updates when the file changes


== Slides

* Based on RevealJS
* `asciidoctor-revealjs` plugin
* Requires a build step


== Event Notify Test Runner

* Watches files
* Runs a command on change
* `brew install entr` or `apt install entr`
* `./watch.sh`


== Deploying

* Github Pages build `adoc` via Jekyll
* But not slides...
* TravisCI auto-build/deploy
* Change text, push, done!


== Existing options

https://clojure.org/community/training

[NOTE.speaker]

* Good options but...
* Didn't provide training material I could use
* Not very Enterprise

[state=title]
== Observations

.Learning Clojure is challenging
image::img/talk/corgi-training.jpg[Corgi jumping a bar]


== Change of thinking required

.Woha, I get it!
image::img/talk/corgi-lights.png[Corgi in lights]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* A mental shift is required
* Think in sequences
* Think in maps, sets, vectors
* Think in aggregation
* Everything is a function
* Passing lots of arguments or data is O.K.
* Took me a long time
* See it in others
* Some people get it quickly, some never do
* Check your preconception at the door
* Embrace the idioms
* Style guide

== Simple ain't easy

"I had high hopes for Clojure for a while, but they're fairly user-hostile, even if they think (and loudly assert) that they aren't."
-- Steve Yegge

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's easy to forget our own path to enlightenment
* New users face difficult obstacles
* Example: just installing Java, Leiningen, IDEA
* Java - which version? Quite easy to choose the wrong thing
* Lein - doesn't work on Windows
* IDEA - make sure you configure your SDK!
  - And get Cursive!
  - And now your parenthesis are out of your control
* Objectively I think it is fair to call Clojure user hostile
  - Error messages
  - Tooling setup
* We can see beyond these difficulties
* But a little empathy goes a long way with beginners
* They often blocked with something easily resolved by a question
* Important to be approachable and sympathetic
--


== Tips for learning

* Focus on the language first
* Focus on the mental shift second
* Delay investing in tools and editors
* Join the community
* Find a teacher
* Ask questions
* *Practise*
* *Read code*
* 4Clojure


== Join the community

"I am so happy with, and proud of, the Clojure community.
 People are helpful, and respectful, and positive."
-- Rich Hickey

* ClojureVerse
* StackOverflow [clojure] [clojurescript]
* Google group: Clojure
* Clojurians


[state=title]
== At work

.How did I get here?
image::img/corgi.jpg[Corgi with tie and glasses]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* Part one of this talk was about providing a course
* Part two is sharing my path
* And to do that I must first begin with how I came to Clojure

== Rewind << 2007

.My first encounter with Lisp
image::img/talk/corgi-encounter.jpg[Corgi encounters budgie]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In 2007 I was a bit of a know it all kind of programmer
* Hiring an engineer, their code submission was... concise, elegant
* I didn’t understand it
* It was in a language I didn’t know
* I thought I knew all the languages: C, C++ and Java
* It must be one of those weird languages we dabbled with at university like prolog or haskell
* It was Lisp
* Well fine, I can program in any language, I’ll just learn the constructs and...
* Six months later I was ready to put lisp back in it’s box
* I’d worked through SICP and onlisp, and written small programs
* There was an elegance to the concepts,
* but applying them to the kinds of computation I wanted to do was not practical
* Then this happened:

Hello,

As someone interested in Foil or jFli, I thought you might want to
know about my latest project - Clojure, a dialect of Lisp for the
JVM. It's currently alpha, but fairly complete. I'm looking for some
feedback from some intrepid folks willing to kick the tires.
http://clojure.sourceforge.net/

Please use the Google group for feedback:
http://groups.google.com/group/clojure

Regards and thanks,

Rich

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I was instantly hooked
* I could build stuff!
* Even render 3d images!
* Fnil - completely new way of thinking, solves a real problem in an unexpected way.
* Not really an option for my day job
* Clojure was for personal projects
--


== 2010

image::img/talk/corgi-team.jpg[Corgis carrying a branch together]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Managing a team of 12 people building logistics software
* Using C#
* Agile
* I build Version One plugins
* Technical challenges would be so much easier in Clojure
* But how could I transition my team over?
* I didn't think it was possible on my own
--


== Why didn't I convert my team to Clojure?

.I can't do this on my own
image::img/talk/corgi-asleep-at-vet.jpg[Corgi asleep at the vet]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What prevents companies from sliding into Clojure en masse?
* What prevented me from converting my team to Clojure?
* Main obstacle; How could I get my team up and running on Clojure quickly
* It felt like it was too much to do on my own
* Needed training, another expert, C-level buy in
* It's hard to believe that you can switch languages effectively without some help
* You do need some help
* What can we do about it?
--


== Many people don't know Clojure

.Looking different can feel weird
image::img/talk/corgi-weird.jpeg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's natural to be suspicious of what we don't know
* They have real concerns
  - Is it really better?
  - Is this for "regular" programmers?
  - Can we learn it?
  - Who will support it?
  - Can we hire people?
  - Why are you wasting your time on something so obscure?
* Explaining isn't enough
--


== What were *developers* waiting for?

.Jobs!
image::img/talk/clojure-jobs.png[Clojure job listings]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* At the time there were not many Clojure jobs advertised
* Now there are
* Google group topics labeled [JOB] (anyone can post)
* Clojure for the Brave and True
* Twitter
* Clojure/conj
--


== What were *companies* waiting for?

.Developers!
image::img/talk/corgi-developer.jpg[Corgi using a laptop]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's hard to hire for Clojure
  - not anymore though
  - my experiences at Outpace and Suiteness
  - no need to hire for Clojure specifically anyway
  - Clojure is a perk, not a barrier
--


== What were *learners* waiting for?

.A market!
image::img/talk/corgi-student.png[Corgi student]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The first question a beginner asks is which language should I learn?
* The standard answer is JavaScript, Java, Python
* Clojure is a better tools for thought
  - Maps/sets/vectors
  - Concise algorithm expression
  - Focus on important concepts
  - Less baggage and distractions
  - Reach mastery of algorithmic concepts faster
* Supply and demand is not as simple as "most used"
  - Supply and demand does not favor the most popular
  - The most popular market is also the most average market
  - You will benefit from an imbalance in supply to demand found in smaller markets
* The future is ... the future
  - You will be writing something else in the future
  - I have used a different programming language in every job I have worked
  - Good employers value skills, knowledge and culture over specific technology experience
  - Fortran, Cobol, VisualBasic, PHP, C# were the popular choices once
  - Things change
  - Optimize for computer science mastery, not basics
  - Language choice matters
--


== What were *employees* waiting for?

.A greenfield!
image::img/talk/corgi-on-field.jpg[Corgi on a green field]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Room to do things right
* Figure out what that means
* But why not do some boring stuff too?
--


== What were *employers* waiting for?

.A framework!
image::img/talk/corgi-in-crate.jpg[Corgi in dog crate]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Something to start with and add to
* Get going quickly
* Structure
* That's all totally possible
--


== 2014

.Enterprise facing Clojure startup
image::img/talk/corgi-herding-ducks.jpg[Corgi herding ducks]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Joined a Clojure startup
* Built an entirely new Clojure/ClojureScript core product
* Clojure scales
* Large teams
* Large codebase
* Build an entire system in a month
* Training people wasn't so hard
--


== 2018

.Customer facing Clojure startup
image::img/talk/suiteness.png[Suiteness logo]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Suiteness is the place to find rooms that connect to suites for half the price of a 2 bedroom suite.
* So you can stretch out without stretching your budget.
* Or you can find all the space and affordability of a vacation rental with the amenities of a hotel.
* Our biggest users are families and group events.
* Built on Clojure/ClojureScript
  - make recruiting easy
  - productive tech stack

== Is Clojure Enterprise?

image::img/talk/popularity.png[Language popularity]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It is for me
* I get to use it at work
* I've built Enterprise Systems with it
* Several large companies do use it
* There are Clojure jobs available
* Companies are recruiting for Clojure experience
* It's getting popular
--


== Or not?

image::img/talk/most-used-jvm.jpg[Most used JVM languages]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Still a niche
* Secret weapon, and that's O.K.
* Value principles over popularity
  - simplicity
  - thinking
  - community
--


== Why do I care?

* Clojure makes me happy
* I want you to be happy too
* There are obstacles
* There is uncertainty
* There is opportunity


== Clojure adoption

.A challenging knot to approach
image::img/talk/corgi-rope.jpg[Corgi pulling a rope]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Clojure adoption seems like a challenging knot to approach
* In 333 B.C. Alexander the Great marched his army into Gordium in modern day Turkey
* He encountered an ancient wagon tied with knots so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened
* Tradition held that the wagon had once belonged to Gordius, the father of the celebrated King Midas
* An oracle had declared that anyone who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia
* Alexander proclaimed "It makes no difference how they are loosed," drew his sword and sliced the knot in half with a single stroke
* The Gordian Knot story is one to take inspiration from
* Don't over-think it, see past implied limitations, be decisive
--


== Clojure is a great choice for your company

* Books
* Great community
* Experts
* Jobs
* Cognitect
* Training
* *Build better stuff faster*


== So what are you waiting for?

.Start using Clojure already!
image::img/talk/corgi-training.jpeg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Hopefully my training course can give you the confidence to get started
* I'd love to help you get a strong start
